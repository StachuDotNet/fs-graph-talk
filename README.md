# fs-graph-talk

The purpose of this repo is to contain the research notes, organization, and code relevant to a(n in-progress) talk around "F# + Graphs."

The exact topic has not yet been chosen.

Minimally, the talk should:
- describe what graphs are and what problems they can help to solve
- show sample implementation for multiple types of graphs
- explore how to store structured data in a graph database
- go over the general 'graph' landscape, incl. graph theory, graph DBs, graph analysis, etc.
- cover my specific use case for a graph DB, an organization software that I'm developing to replace my use of a few org. tools incl. Jira, GitHub, Dynalist, etc.
